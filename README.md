# portifolio
a personal portifolio that im working on
i was making a better version of this with react but i had a problem with git
now i'm leaving this in here.
This "portifolio" is something that i started doing on a course and at that time i wasn't thinking about
doing a big portifolio, and to be honest for now that is quite simple.
Since i didn't finish because i decided to make a better one using react js and tailwind
instead of vanilla js.
The concept of what i'm doing with this kinda exists in this version
although its far from the real portifolio.
